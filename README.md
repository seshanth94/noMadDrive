created a similar to Amazon S3 data storage application called noMadDrive which is usable and provides functionality as commercial cloud services
To make it secure, noMad- Drive applies the following security mechanisms.
Confidentiality: Applied encryption and decryption processes by using 256 bits AES to protect files from unauthorized disclosure.
Integrity: Apply HMAC (Message Authentication Codes Based on Hash Function) to detect any unautho-rized change of files stored in S3 storage.
Security Notification: Applied Twilio, which is a text messaging service API that allows the application to notify security problem immediately.
Usability: Created all features which mostly and necessarily are in the commercial cloud storage services including file operations and data synchronization.
